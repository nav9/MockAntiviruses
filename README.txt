MockAntiviruses
===============

Two fake antivirus programs I created to fool my uncle into believing that his computer was infected. The fprot program and mwav program are two separate programs. Fprot works only in GW-BASIC, and on running it, you'll have to type "system" and then "fprot" to run it. It was meant to mimic the process of exiting gw-basic and running fprot from the commandline.
